# This is Ian Harland Exercise repo

we use **this file** to practice mark down

we have tried:

1. `git clone`: this is how you copy/download a repo
2. `git status`: this shows the status of the current repo
3. `git add .`: this stages all changes
4. `git commit -am "commit msg"`: this commits the changes


in-class exercise for misy 350 spring 2018
